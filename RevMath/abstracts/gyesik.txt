This talk is an introduction to an ongoing project with Hugo Herbelin
and Keiko Nakta.

In the first part, we first introduce a way how to characterize the
big five systems of second-order arithmetic in terms of
interpolation. 

In the second part, it will be shown that there are various forms of
RCA_0 which are probably not equivalent in a constructive sense.
