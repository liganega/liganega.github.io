I will look at a notion of finiteness from a viewpoint of constructive
mathematics. Constructively, there are at least four positive
definitions for a set of natural numbers being finite: (i) the set is
given by a list (enumerated sets) (ii) there exists a bound such that
any list over the set contains duplicates whenever its length exceeds
the bound (size-bounded sets) (iii) the root of the tree of
duplicate-free lists over the set is inductively accessible
(Noetherian sets) (iv) every stream over the set has a duplicate
(streamless sets). The four variations form a hierarchy of strictly
decreasing strength constructively, but the hierarchy collapses
classically. For the first three of them, we can characterize the
differences in strength in a precise way in terms of a weak instance
of the Law of Excluded Middle. In the first part of the talk, I will
review these four alternative definitions of finiteness. In the
second part, I will present our on-going work, aiming at positively
answering to our conjecture that it is constructively unprovable that
a streamless set is Noetherian.
