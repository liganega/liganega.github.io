<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

This paper introduces a representation style of variable binding using dependent types. 
Our representation is a variation of the Coquand-McKinna-Pollack's locally-named representation.
The main characteristic of our representation is the use of dependent families in defining
expressions such as terms and formulas. 
We also showed some hidden utility of simultaneous substitution and simultaneous renaming.
Consequently, we can deal with definitions and proofs in a more compact way, 
among which well-formedness, provability, soundness,  and completeness.
In order to confirm the feasibility of our idea we made several experiments using the 
proof assistant Coq which supports all the functionalities we need: 
intentional type theory, dependent types, 
inductive families, and simultaneous substitution.
Moreover, we could reveal a new aspect of locally-named representation style that 
it can be regarded as a nominal approach under the condition that proofs-as-programs is
not a part of the domain of the discourse.

<h3><a name="motive">Motivations</a></h3>
This work started with the observation that, in Frege's work
such as <i>Begriffsschrift</i> and <i>Basic Laws of Arithmetic</i>,
parameters(also called free variables) play essentially no role. 

And this drove us to check whether we could show
the same meta-theoretic results even when we do not involve 
parameters to the language.
<br>

Another motivation was the observation that locally-named representation
and locally nameless representation are both too permissive in defining raw terms.
Some terms could not have meaning because they contain free occurrences
of some local variables which are subject to be bound.
It is a distinctive feature of (McKinna & Pollack 1999) 
that they introduced a way of avoiding appeal to such well-formedness
considerations except in a very small number of places such as the definition of typing
rules.
<br>

In order to remove the necessity of using extra syntax for well-formed terms at all,
we use <i>traces</i> to control the information of local variables occurring in the construction
of terms. Our idea is very close to that used in the typechecker example by (McBride &
McKinna, 2004, Section 7) and the use in Agda of families indexed by Nat to represent
well-scoped terms.
<br>

Finally, we were interested in the utility of simultaneous substitution. 
Although some people have already showed the importance of simultaneous
substitution in formal reasoning about languages with binding,
we believed that there were still some hidden properties about it.

For example, there are cases where simultaneous substitution is not a choice, but a
must. 
Moreover, simultaneous substitution can be used 
in saving infrastructure for a formal reasoning.

The proof scripts can be compiled on Coq8.4.pl6. 
It should also work with previous versions such as 8.4 and 8.3.
